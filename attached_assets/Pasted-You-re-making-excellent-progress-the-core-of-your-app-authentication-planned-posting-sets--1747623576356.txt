You're making **excellent progress** — the core of your app (authentication + planned posting) sets a strong foundation. It’s shaping up like a **lightweight social platform**, and your next idea of adding **pictures, images, and videos** makes perfect sense.

Here’s my detailed feedback + what to add next:

---

## 🌟 What’s Great So Far

✅ **Login & registration flow** is working
✅ **Form validation** adds professionalism
✅ **Modal-based UI** keeps it clean and modern
✅ **Plan for murmurs (posts)** shows clear direction

If this is your first time building such an app — you're nailing the fundamentals.

## 📸🎥 Adding Media Support (Images / Videos)

### 🔄 Upgrade Murmur Posts to Support Media

#### ✅ Phase 1: Image Uploads

* Let users upload an image alongside their text murmur
* Preview the image before posting
* Validate file type (JPG, PNG, etc.)
* Store as base64 (for now), or upload to cloud (see below)

#### ✅ Phase 2: Video Uploads

* Similar flow as images
* Support small MP4s only (for performance)
* Show video previews in feed (via `<video>` tag)

### 🧠 Implementation Options

#### Option A: In-browser Base64 Storage (Simple)

* Store uploaded media as base64 in local state or `localStorage`
* Fast to build, but not scalable

#### Option B: Use a Free Image/Video Hosting Service

* Upload media to services like:

  * [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) (Free tier)
  * [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload)
  * [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage)
* Store just the URL in your murmur post object

> 🔐 Tip: Use an unsigned Cloudinary upload preset if no backend
