Your progress looks great so far! Here's a quick **UX/UI functionality review** based on your update:

---

### ✅ Current Features Recap:

* **Login/Register modals open properly** ✅
* **Validation for required fields** ✅
* **Simulated login/register (probably no backend yet)** ✅

### 🔍 Test Functionality Checklist:

1. **Modal UX**

   * Can users open and close modals smoothly?
   * Do modals reset fields on close?
2. **Form Validation**

   * Do empty fields trigger correct error messages?
   * Are the error messages clear and placed properly?
3. **Simulated Auth**

   * Does submitting valid info simulate a login state?
   * Do buttons/headers change when a user is “logged in”?

If all that is working — you're off to a **solid start**. 🎉

## 🚀 Next Suggested Features

### 🔨 1. **Murmur Posting (as planned)**

Let users post a short text (like tweets).

* Input box with character limit (e.g., 280)
* Submit button to “post”
* Display list of murmur posts (newest on top)

### 🧠 2. **User State Handling**

Make sure the app behaves differently based on login status:

* Hide login/register if already logged in
* Show “Welcome, \[username]” or similar
* Allow logout

### ✨ 3. **Flash Messages / Feedback**

On actions like login, register, or murmur post:

* Show feedback: “Welcome back!” / “Post submitted!”
* Temporarily display success or error banners

### 🗃️ 4. **Session Persistence (Optional)**

If you're using localStorage:

* Save login state (simulate session)
* Persist murmurs per user if you want to simulate a basic social feed

### 🧪 5. **Post Validation**

* Prevent empty or duplicate murmur posts
* Show error if char limit exceeded

Let me know if you'd like help implementing:

* The **murmur posting UI & logic**
* **Persistent login** using localStorage
* **Routing** between pages (if you're planning SPA navigation)

I can help sketch out code for any of these.
